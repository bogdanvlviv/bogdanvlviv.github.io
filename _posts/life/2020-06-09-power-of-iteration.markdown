Keep in mind:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">People frequently say that they iterate while they are only revising. The difference is that iterations should go all the way to the end of the process (shipped). If you change a draft blog post that is a revision. If you publish a smaller blog post much faster that is iteration.</p>&mdash; Sid Sijbrandij (@sytses) <a href="https://twitter.com/sytses/status/1393023657685897217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2021</a></blockquote>
