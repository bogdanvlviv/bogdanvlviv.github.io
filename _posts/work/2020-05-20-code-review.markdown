I had wanted to share some thoughts on "code review" till I read two comprehensive posts that complement each other I would say:

- Google's Code Review Guidelines: [https://google.github.io/eng-practices/](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/)
- Great Code Reviews—The Superpower Your Team Needs: [https://engineering.shopify.com/blogs/engineering/great-code-reviews](https://engineering.shopify.com/blogs/engineering/great-code-reviews)

In addition, I want to highlight:

- Code review is an opportunity to learn.
- Code review is an opportunity to teach.
- Code review is a place where we make a huge impact on a product.

Do not neglect code review. Cheers!
